## Overview
The main goal is to provide accurate, transparent, and verifiable answers while reducing the spread of unauthenticated or fabricated hadiths.

## Key Idea
Most AI systems mix reliable and unreliable sources, which can lead to incorrect answers.

## Features
• Searches within authenticated Hadith books  
• Extracts answers directly from the source text  
• Uses AI to analyze and simplify the extracted text  
• Provides clear references (book name & page number)  
• No hallucinated answers  
• If the answer is not found in the sources, the system does not fabricate a response  

## Project Status
Early development stage currently focused on:
• Initially supports one trusted Hadith book  
• Accurate retrieval  
• Reference transparency  

## Future Plans
• Support for multiple books  
• Advanced query understanding  
• Multi-language responses  
• Web and mobile interfaces
